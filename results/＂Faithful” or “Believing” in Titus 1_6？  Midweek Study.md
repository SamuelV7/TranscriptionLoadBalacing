If any man is beyond reproach, the husband of one wife, having faithful children who are not accused of dissipation or rebellious for an overseer must be beyond reproach as God's steward. Not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not addicted to wine, not pugnacious, not fond of dishonest gain, but hospitable, loving what is good, sensible, righteous, holy, self-controlled, holding fast the faithful word which is in accordance with the teaching so that he will be able both to exhort in sound doctrine and to reprove those who contradict. For there are many rebellious men, empty talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision, who must be silenced because they're upsetting whole families, teaching things which they should not teach for the sake of dishonest gain. All right, that's the background in Titus. In 1 Timothy, a similar passage giving qualifications for elders is chapter 3. It is a trustworthy saying, if any man aspires to the office of overseer, he desires a good work. An overseer then must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, sensible, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, not addicted to wine or pugnacious, but considerate, peaceable, free from the love of money, leading his own household well, having his children in submission with all dignity. But if a man does not know how to lead his own household, how will he take care of the church of God? And not a new convert so that he will not become conceited and fall into the condemnation of the devil. He must have a good reputation with those outside the church so that he will not fall into reproach and the snare of the devil. Now that just gives you the two passages which deal with elder qualifications, both of them. One written to Titus on the island of Crete, one written to Timothy in Ephesus, both of them preparing God's servants in those locations to be able to evaluate potential candidates for eldership, which is what we're doing. We're at the stage in the life of our church where we're saying, we need homegrown elders and we need as elders to be considering men for the future of the church as homegrown leaders. We need you to be thinking about this biblically so that when it comes to you nominating people for us to consider as potential elders, you're not nominating Fred. We don't have a Fred here anymore, do we? You're not nominating Fred who's got a problem with women in general and can't control himself in all sorts of other ways. Or you're not nominating Bill who's the businessman because he could run the church really well and lead us into growth or something like that. So we're saying what we want is to be biblical. We're studying the qualifications for those reasons and here we are at Titus 1.6. We've hit an interpretive difficulty. I've laid it out for you, those who believe that the correct translation of what the word faithful here is in the LSB should be believe, children who believe or children who are faithful. Donovan, do people have the document now? All right, so if you want to open it up, I'm going to lay out for you now fairly quickly but hopefully carefully this summary. Please notice this is the document, the children who believe position dated 13th May. If you see the footnote, this is titled a summary of the notes I took from John MacArthur's sermon on Titus 1.6. The title of his sermon is The Required Character for a Pastor, Family Leadership. You see the footnote there, I'll give you the link to his sermon but I'm also noting this is the summary of my own summary. I went through his sermon and took notes at length, stopping and repeating and stopping and repeating. I don't know how many times I've listened to that sermon, probably 20 or more over the last few years. I've listened to it and listened to it and listened to it. I've attempted to show the structure of his argument and so I'm giving it to you in my own words with my own bullet points and my own wording but I'm trying to reproduce the actual argument. I'd love to see his notes for this sermon because I have a feeling his notes would look something like what I have here but there we are. So these are just bullet points but the first main point he seems to make is that wild and unbelieving children mean an elder is not above reproach. Wild, unbelieving children mean that an elder is not above reproach and within that argument he fills it out by describing the reality that leadership is primarily example. It backs that up, 1 Thessalonians 2, 7 where Paul talks about him being like a spiritual parent and believers being like children for those who do the work of pastoring and evangelising and so the role of a leader he says is like a parent and we parent by example and the best test then of a potential leader, we're talking about potential leaders and qualifications, the best test MacArthur argues of leadership is leadership in the home which is the proving ground. Now you heard me make the same argument just the other week but then MacArthur says this which is different to what I was saying, is he able to lead someone to Christ by the power of his testimony and consistency and he makes the point that having wild and uncontrolled children who live in rebellion and reject the gospel questions the integrity of his message and you'll see here where I put him in quotes, I'm quoting him directly but you'll see that I'm summarising some of those quotes so there's large bits left out, go read it for yourself. You can read the transcript on the GTY page and get everything. Now MacArthur then having made the point that leadership is best tested in the home and that leadership is primarily that of example and the question is, is someone able to lead his children to Christ by the power of his testimony and his consistency? He makes the case that the classic objection to that that people bring is, well if that's the case what about election? If you're saying MacArthur that an elder, the test of an elder's qualification is that his children should be believers and led to Christ through the power of his testimony and the impressive nature of his consistent life at home, if that's the case MacArthur, but what about election? What about if his children are not elect? And then to counter that, MacArthur does a great job of stating the fact that salvation comes through faithful witness and godly example and he uses many texts to prove that God uses means. Now please notice that word means, I'll come back to it later in my own argument but it's undoubtable and MacArthur proves it wonderfully well and if you wanted a good place to go to get that proved to you, there are many texts and many arguments to show that God does use means in the salvation of souls. A prime example he gave is the power of Christian parenting in 1 Corinthians 7 and the argument that's there about your children being holy. If you see the footnote, MacArthur says, footnote 2, it should be the pattern in a Christian marriage that you have holy children and that if Christianity is real and if those believing ones, he's talking about the parents at that point, are faithful to live out what they say they believe. In other words, if parents are faithful to live godly lives and it ought to be the normal, and he says that in the phrase just before the quote that I've given you there, it ought to be normal for children to be converted and to be holy in that sense. And so he says, look, to say it's about election is fatalistic and just wrong and the application of that is how can we teach you, how can we as elders teach you how to raise a godly generation, which is what we're supposed to do, if we can't do it. Now if you're not tracking with me, if you are tracking with me, I hope you're feeling like that's a powerful argument. That's a very powerful argument. How can we teach you how to do something that we can't do? That's a really strong rhetorical point. And then he begins his exegesis of the text. I just point out the fact that up to this point he's not begun the exegesis of his text and that's great comfort to me because in my sermon I just realised this, that I did the same. I made a big background argument and then I came to the exegesis of the text. So here we go. Then he begins his exegesis of the text, tekna echoen pista, that's the Greek, having children who believe, having he says echoen is just the present tense. Don't know why I've put a kiss at the end of the tense but it's there in the notes. Then children, tekna, the dictionary meaning, the lexical meaning is children but he notes that there's no reference to age in the term itself. He points out it's the same word as in Titus 1.4 and refers to, where Titus, Paul refers to Titus who's an adult as my true child using the same term. So the word tekna, teknon, it doesn't tell you how old the child is, it just simply means sons and daughters or offspring. Page two if you're wondering where we are. So his next argument is basically to say that it's the context of this word tekna, children, in Titus 1.6. The context indicates that older children are what are in view and he points to the fact that the next phrase, not accused of dissipation or rebellion, hardly refers to little children. You can't say little children are going to be out involved in dissipation. Dissipation is drunkenness, debauchery. It's the kind of wild unrestrained living that the prodigal's son is accused of. Well that's, MacArthur points out, pointing to older children and he says not accused of, I'll get on to that in a moment, where am I? So elders by different definition he says, were typically older men more likely to have older children. Now the next phrase, who believe, pista, this is something that people object to and they say it can't mean who believe because it must mean that he's voicing the objection to his position and he's saying it just means merely obedient to parents, not necessarily Christians. Now MacArthur argues against that and he says this assumes that the little children, since adult children, don't have to be obedient to their parents. But it can't be little children, he's saying about this in Titus 1.6. He's arguing for the passage in Titus 1.6 must refer to older children. He says it can't be little children since, it says, they're not accused of dissipation or rebellion, which is a very graphic description of wild, unruly, disorded, lascivious living not applicable to little children. So he's made the same point again very strongly. Then he would say, well look, other people object, what if the children are not old enough to believe? And he says 1 Timothy 3 covers that. I read that to you before we began. So he says it must refer to younger children because adult children are not kept under control. That's the picture in 1 Timothy 3 is having your children in subjection under control. And he says you don't keep adult children under control. So the emphasis in 1 Timothy 3, he says, is on controlling the household, keeping the children under control with all dignity. And he says so the picture there in 1 Timothy 3 is young children. The picture in Titus is older children. And so then he talks about the meaning of pista, translated in his view, who believe. And he points out that the opposite word, apistos, r meaning the negating letter in Greek, the alpha privative as it's called, apistos means to not believe. It means disbelief and unbelief. Therefore, he says it's best to take pistos as simply believing, just as he says, just in the simplicity of the word. And then he asks rhetorically, can it be translated as faithful in the sense of loyal or trustworthy? And he says yes. So this is the position I'm arguing for. He says yes, it has both an active and a passive sense. The active sense is talking about one who believes, one who trusts. The passive sense is talking about one who is to be believed or who is to be trusted. But, he argues, this term faithful is only used to apply to believers. Even if it is translated as faithful, the obvious question then is faithful to what? And the obvious answer is faithful to what their father taught them, the gospel. Now I'm going to give you some quotes. Faithful therefore means faithful to what he believes, talking about the father believes. And then take this longer quote. To take the word faithful, pull it out of the believing context, isolate it as if it only meant submissive to the father's leadership without believing what the father taught, would be to distort the word. And I don't think he means word with a capital W, he means the word faithful. Careful study confirms this believing context. Every scripture in the New Testament I looked at, I got them all where the word is used. It always refers to believers unless it's referring to an inanimate object or God or Christ. So the conclusion so far. So what is Paul saying? He's saying not only is this man to have children who believe, but children who are also what? Faithful to what they believe. That's what's implied in the rest of the statement, not accused of dissipation or rebellion. They believe it and they live it. They believe it and they live it. Another quote. So many people want to leave this matter of salvation out and say he doesn't have to have saved children as long as they just submit. Well, what are you going to do right here when you get to this point? How can they be called faithful if they don't believe what they must be faithful to? And if they're adult children here, they certainly wouldn't be obeying their father. Faithful would mean nothing. And then he talks about 1 Timothy 3, 4 to 5 and shows that that looks at children when they're young. When they're young, they're under control. They believe what their little hearts can believe and they affirm whatever they can understand and they live by those principles being taught them by their parents. And someday that blooms into saving faith. The church ought to be able to look at that man's life and see that process taking place, see those little children affirming, believing as much as their simple hearts can believe. We could say believing with simple faith progressing towards a saving faith. But when it comes to the point that they're old enough to believe, they are to be faithful to the truth that they have been taught. So I hope you're tracking, is everyone tracking with me? Have you got it on the page and you're able to follow? Then in his sermon he moves on to the exegesis of the next phrase which in Greek, mer en categoria assotias anupotakta, not accused of dissipation or rebellion. Dissipation is the word assotia, literally meaning without saving, saving nothing, just throwing yourself away, indulgent. It means wild, wasteful. It's associated with drunkenness, wild revelry, pagan festivals. And you can see his point there earlier about that indicating that this has got all the children in view in Titus 1.6. Rebellion he says means basically out of control, wild, unruly. And his conclusion on the next page, his children are to be believers who are faithful, who live obediently under control when they're small following their father's faith until it emerges into their own faith. And at that point they don't live a wild and rebellious, out of control, unruly, wasteful life, but they live a faithful Christian life. And another quote, a pastor who has children who are wild, self-indulgent, disobedient and rebellious, even if they claim to be Christians, is not suited to be an elder or a pastor. Now that's my summary of his message and I hope that that's a fair summary. You can evaluate it against the original. You'll see if you do that my bullet points are my own, my structure is an attempt to reproduce his argument, not to reproduce every nuance in it, but I've tried to capture the whole thrust of it so you get the picture. And just an additional note I've put there from MacArthur's commentary on Titus. You can see his commentary is basically drawn from his sermons and you can see it's argued succinctly here, unbelievers are never referred to as faithful. That's a point earlier he made when he said, I looked at all the texts and the context is always believers. That fact alone argues strongly for the rendering here of children who believe, that's my emphasis, I think, no it's not his emphasis, that is who have placed their faith in Jesus Christ. Even if the idea were that of faithfulness to parents, the use of pistos in those other passages would argue for its referring to faithfulness, the faithfulness of believing children in an elders home, especially a child who is old enough to be saved but is not can hardly be considered faithful. He would be unfaithful in by far the most important way. Now I think that summarises his argument exceptionally well and that's what I would refer you to as a very good succinct statement of MacArthur's argument, it's there in his commentary, you can get the commentary for yourself, you need to have that commentary on your shelf by the way. And I've just put here as a footnote, it's worth noting that MacArthur's not alone in holding this view, this view is obviously held by some Bible translators, that's significant, never dismiss Bible translators as being somehow ignorant of the language, they're often experts and when they translate it they should be, you know, we have to differ with them but you should only differ with them intelligently, not lightly, Bible translators who agree with MacArthur, he's not alone, also significant Bible teachers like John Stott from All Souls Langham Place, this is a quote from John Stott, I didn't read it in its original source, I got it from Nine Marks article where they quoted him, he said, an extension of the same principle may be that presbyter bishops can hardly be expected to win strangers to Christ if they have failed to win those who are most exposed to their influence, their own children. Now John Stott didn't have children but he had the same view as a single man with no children that MacArthur held and MacArthur has many children, all of them loving the Lord, many grandchildren growing up with a wonderful faithful heritage being passed on to them, that's a very powerful argument right there and MacArthur's life and the legacy of his ministry present a very powerful testimony to why we should take a position like this very seriously. Okay, I hope I've given you the believing view adequately, my job now is to give you my own view and try to say why I differ, okay, so if you want to find the other article, the faithful children position stated today, these are just my notes from today but you'll know that I didn't make it all up today because I preached it on Sunday and I've been working on this for a long time. I take the faithful view which I argued on Sunday and I'm going to, I've given you here summary of the sermon begins on page one and the summary of the sermon is going to go all the way to page five, if you want to find your way to page five, I'm not going to take you through a summary of my sermon because I'm going to assume that you heard it and that you can remember every word I said, no, you can't do that I'm sure but you can ask me questions on what you heard later for clarification or questions for discussion. But having worked on this for a number of years and intensively studied it, my own conclusion is that the correct translation ought to be faithful rather than believing and so to help you evaluate that for yourself, on Sunday I gave you 15 reasons why I choose faithful as opposed to believing and I just zipped through them and it was like I started at the one hour mark of my sermon which is not the best place to start for people to be able to listen so thankfully tonight you're all in better shape, you've had a good day's work, rest and you're here just feeling ready to go with some good technical exegetical arguments, you ready for that? Because we're going to go deep now into the exegesis of the text, that's where it all starts right and this is where I was saying to Michael earlier and Adam, I so admire our friend John MacArthur because he basically exegetes the text and he'll stick to wherever that leads him, he's just going to say well that's what the text says, well that's what I believe and let the chips fall where they may, I love that about him, that's what he taught us and I have to follow that same principle even if it means I disagree with him and that doesn't mean I fall out with him, doesn't mean I'm arguing against him or against his position but I have to follow the exegesis of the text, I can't differ with what I believe the text says in order to agree with my friend John MacArthur or anything else or anyone else. So this is where I am so help me God, the exegetical reasons we get seven of these and these are more technical and we'll start with them and we'll come on to four theological reasons and four logical reasons so the total is still 15, I've changed one of them to, restructured one of them to clarify it so it'll be slightly different on I think 0.9 or something like that, we'll see, no it's not, it's 0.6. So we'll get there, I hope you'll track with me, are you ready for some counter arguments? First to state his case seems right till another comes and questions him, right? You're going to hopefully experience that tonight and it's down to you to be Bereans and search the scriptures if these things are so or not. So the Greek word first of all, exegetical reasons, more technical reasons at the bottom, the Greek word pistos here can legitimately mean loyal, trustworthy, faithful and not just believing. Now MacArthur didn't argue with that, MacArthur made the same point, I'll just reiterate it here, there's no question and you've just got to understand this in your minds and hold it in your minds because if you get hold of something that MacArthur said and missed this you might think I'm being unfair to the text but I'm not, MacArthur made the same point. There is no question that in the New Testament the adjective pistos is commonly used for believers but there's also no doubt that it is legitimate to translate it as faithful in the sense of loyal, trustworthy, obedient. And the key to understanding how that's possible is to understand this, that the main idea in the word is the idea of trust, that's if you go back as I did to study the word in its whole history and you look at the ancient Greek use of the word, the basic concept that goes right back is the idea of trust and within that basic concept you can either in an active sense, active is you the person, the subject of the verb doing the action, so the active sense is you're the one doing the trusting, hence the translation believing because trusting is believing, or in its passive sense you could say that you're the one being trusted. The idea then seems to be that you are trustworthy and you've got to understand that words change in their usage over time and so they can end up with a meaning which has shifted from the original sense that it had. But those are the two basic concepts in the word, either actively trusting or passive sense trustworthy, worthy of trust. Now the question is whether the pistos has somehow become over time like a technical term among Christians to say the word believers so that they would never use it in a non-religious sense. You maybe heard that in MacArthur's argument that he looked at all the texts and it's always in that sense of believing. Now the question is, is that the case? You'd need to have firm evidence for that kind of a claim and MacArthur never claims that it's a technical term and has become that but he claims that that's the only use that's found. The reality I'm saying is that in non-religious settings this word, pistos, is actually a very common word that just means faithful in the sense of being loyal or trustworthy. So that's my first reason. My first reason that I've given you is that the word can legitimately mean loyal, trustworthy or faithful because of the two senses. My second reason now is to say that actually this word pistos is used very commonly elsewhere, even of unbelievers, to mean loyal, trustworthy and faithful. I would say the key to understanding that is to look at the usage that Josephus makes of it, the Greek-speaking Jewish historian Josephus. He wrote History of the Jewish People. He wrote about the same time as the New Testament was being composed. That's very interesting because he wrote in Greek. The New Testament is in Greek and so if you're looking for contemporary usage of New Testament Greek words in ordinary life, Josephus is using it for ordinary Greek speakers. He's directing his Antiquities of the Jews at the Romans, trying to make an apology to the Romans for the existence of the Jewish nation. So as he's using these ordinary words in an ordinary way to ordinary Greek speakers, we get insight into ordinary meaning for ordinary words, not just how it's used in the Bible. Next page, page six. Sorry, next page, page seven. Point D, I'm saying here are some examples of pistos used of unbelievers by Josephus in his Antiquities of the Jews. I list a whole load of examples for you. You can just skim your eye down these. First one is talking about the king of Ethiopia who fell deeply in love with Moses, whose daughter fell in love with Moses, according to Josephus. She sent the most faithful of all her servants to discourse with him about their marriage. That's that word, pistos. Josephus describes Saul commanding Jonathan and the most faithful of his servants to kill David. These are footnoted if you want to go and look them up. He describes how Saul, point three, chose two of his most faithful men to go with him to the witch of Endor. You could say, well, they're probably not believers. Then he talks about how Herod wanted to kill Cleopatra and mentions that she would not be faithful to him, seems to be in the sense of being loyal. Well, that's definitely not talking about believers. The next quote gives a very interesting further description of what pistos meant. I've put it there in Greek in case you speak Greek. You've got the translation below. The translation is talking about this man, Sihimas. Josephus writes that, and at the first, Sihimas was faithful to Herod and neglected none of the things he had given him in charge. That's super helpful because it gives us insight into what was included in this concept of being faithful according to this word. Included in that is the idea that he didn't neglect his duties. It's very helpful when people state a term and then unpack it in another phrase and you get some idea of if you're seeing ancient words, you just rejoice when you get a sentence like that because you're like, ah, well now, not only has he used the word I'm looking at, but he's described something that's contained in the meaning of that word next to it and that gives me insight into the meaning of the word. Sure enough, it's the same concept of being faithful in the sense of trustworthy. He did what he was asked to do. No. Josephus speaks of Maryamne again, vile woman, as a chaste woman and faithful to Herod. Josephus speaks about the sons of Babus. Now, the sons of Babus were of great dignity and had power among the multitude and were faithful to Antigonus and were always raising columnies against Herod. And this is just the wars between these ungodly, wicked men who are fighting for control in Judea. And the examples are just too many to list. I had to stop. I got about halfway through the works of Josephus. I'm using a search engine to get these words, so don't feel quite that sorry for me, but it still takes a long time to just troll through all these examples. And some of them are irrelevant, but some of these are very relevant. And they show without a doubt that there is this common usage of the term pistos in ordinary life just to refer to someone who's trustworthy or faithful. Now, my third point is that if you keep that in mind, that there's this ordinary usage which is just in everyday speech, that there are biblical examples of this kind of ordinary use for pistos which don't speak clearly about believers. Now, read my footnote. MacArthur gave some very strong words, which the kind of words that make people like me literally tremble sometimes because you think, I don't want to get this wrong. Please, Lord, don't let me get it wrong. He said to take the word faithful and pull it out of the believing context, isolate it as if it only meant submissive to the Father's leadership without believing what the Father taught would be to distort the word. Now, the first time I read that, I thought he meant distort the word as in the word of God. I'm like, I don't want to distort the word of God. And then I re-read it and re-read it and I'm like, okay, so he's saying to distort the word faithful, I think. But just to say to you, to bear my heart to you, words like that from someone like MacArthur are the kind of things that keep me awake at night because I don't want to get it wrong. And I trust MacArthur more than I trust most any other exegete on the planet at the moment because time and time and time again, I have done this kind of hard work and I've argued with the commentaries and I try not to just go straight to MacArthur and see what he says and then give you that. I want to do the faithful work that he taught us to do, to argue with the text and read the commentaries. Then I read MacArthur and I go, he got it. You know, just time and time and time again he gets it right when all sorts of other people get it wrong and so, you know, I trust the guy. And I wouldn't disagree lightly, but I couldn't find a way to agree with him that every New Testament use of the word pistos is in a believing context. I just can't see how that is true. And so I'm saying in point three that there are biblical examples of this kind of ordinary use for pistos which don't clearly speak about believers. Matthew 25-21 is a good example. His master said to him, well done good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little and I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master. And you could say, oh there you go, that's one of the parables of Jesus on the sermon on Mount Olivet. Well, that's speaking, he's speaking to believers. Yes, he's speaking to believers, but this is inside the parable. And inside the parable, the golden rule of interpretation is don't overexagite the parable. Inside the parable, you've got to take the parable within its own merits and it's not talking about a believer, it's just talking about a servant who's been entrusted with his master's property and faithful here within the parable has nothing to do with being faithful as a Christian. Now, we can take applications from it. I'm talking about the use of the word within the parable. Instead of being faithful as a Christian, it has everything to do with him being trustworthy and loyal and faithful to do what he should do with the money that's been entrusted to him. I didn't put it here, but you could say that's why all the translations don't say, well done, good and believing servant. They say, well done, good and faithful servant because they're saying, no, this is the ordinary secular use. This is not a religious use of that word. This is just the ordinary meaning faithful. I really should have put that here, but please notice that, that I don't know of any translation that translates it believing here and I didn't check them all, but I could pretty much guarantee that there's not a single translation out there that says, well done, good and believing servant because the context is obvious and we'll come to that in a moment, but the context drives the decision about the meaning of the word. We'll come back to that. Okay, 2 Timothy 2.2 is another good example. What you've heard from me in the presence of many witnesses and trust of faithful men who would be able to teach others also. Again, although the context is a believing one in the sense of Paul's talking to Timothy and he's telling him how to choose people to train as teachers. The concept in the word here is clearly that Timothy is to look for reliable and trustworthy men, not simply believing ones. One Corinthians 4.2. Moreover, it's required of stewards that they be found faithful. Again, the picture's looking at an ordinary situation in which Paul draws the comparison between a household manager and himself, but the comparison he's drawing in context isn't faithfulness to manage God's household properly as a household manager, but it's faithfulness to properly handle the mysteries of God that have been entrusted to him. So the picture he draws on is the reality that a household manager is someone entrusted with property that belongs to another. That's the meaning in that word, household manager. It's the same one I gave you the other week, oikonomus. Now, he states the general truth. It is required of household managers that they be found faithful, in other words, trustworthy. So the word is being used not in a religious sense, as if it was a technical term that implied someone believes, but just in an ordinary sense. In Kittel's Theological Dictionary of the New Testament, that's probably the dictionary that MacArthur relied on most during most of his exposition. It's got perhaps the most exhaustive study of this word. I read through dozens and dozens of pages of a dictionary entry on this word. It's painful and useful. It's not thrilling study, but Kittel—this is actually rid of Boltman in the article within that dictionary—notes that the basic difference of use is this, and I've quoted it for you. Speaking about the word pyrstos, he writes, "'This, too, has the two Greek meanings of faithful and trusting,' and he then adds, "'In a secular sense, it is common for faithful.'" Now, notice that in a secular sense. This is not me saying, in the Bible, there are these ordinary secular senses in which it's used. This is the Greek dictionary writer saying that. Now, you don't just necessarily agree with him, but the examples he gives are Matthew 25, 45, and so on. I've listed them for you there. James White has a very helpful article. You can see the link to that in the footnotes. He summarises the fruit of his own exegetical work. He does a lot of that, puts it down in a, I think, a very, very helpful article. Here's the quote from his own summary of his own research. "'Many present the term as simply meaning believer, especially when contrasting believers and unbelievers,' 2 Corinthians 6.15, 1 Timothy 4.10. When he says, many present the term as simply meaning believer, he's saying many texts in the Bible. So he's talking about every time this word crops up in the New Testament, and he lists every single example for you. If you want to go to his article and see that, you could even click on the link now and you could find where I'm at in his article with this quote. But he's saying, of all the texts, many present the term as simply meaning believer, especially when contrasting believers and unbelievers. And then there are those quotes. Elsewhere, it describes a faithful saying. 1 Timothy 4.9. Frequently, it is used to describe God who is faithful. 1 Corinthians 1.8. Obviously, in this context, he's talking about when it's describing God. The translation, believing, would be completely improper. But most important to our purposes is his use when describing individuals. It is often—now please note that, it's not just me saying this—it is often used in the sense of trustworthy or obedient. This usage spans the New Testament corpus from the parables of Jesus to the epistles of Paul. You can go there and he then gives a number of examples and concludes—I'm in point D of my own notes. In each of these instances, pistos, heron, refers not primarily or even secondarily to the concept of being a Christian per se, but to being trustworthy or reliable. So I hope that you're not dying at the moment. If you are, you feel free to just do star jumps or go and get a cup of coffee or take a nap. But if you're not dying and you're with me, that's my third reason. Yes, there are many biblical examples of the use of this word to speak of believers. That's true, many, but it doesn't always refer to believers and that's where I diverge from MacArthur's position. That means that people like me who come to Titus 1.6 and think that it might be being used in its non-religious, ordinary sense of loyal, trustworthy or obedient, we're not distorting the word at that point. So I have to breathe a sigh of relief and say to my friend John MacArthur, I hear what you say but I don't think I'm doing that. Let me just give you my conclusions so far. Number one, the Greek word pistos here can legitimately mean loyal, trustworthy, faithful and not just believing. And if that's true, and number two, the Greek word pistos here is very commonly used elsewhere, even of unbelievers, like in Josephus, to mean loyal, trustworthy and faithful. And number three, there are biblical examples of this kind of use for pistos which don't seem to have the sense of them being believers. If those three are true then, number four, it doesn't automatically mean it means faithful. Number four, look, then the choice of the correct meaning for this word pistos must come from the context. And I'm saying that the context favours faithful. I'm going to argue that now. Now context and the meaning of words. Just quickly, duck! All right. You, let's just to wake you up. All right. How many of you instinctively went like that? Okay. None of you because you didn't see the look on my face. If I went duck, maybe you'd have gone with me. Some of you Americans, if you say the word duck, they want to go like that. Or like that. Yes, very good Adam. So, a duck. A duck can mean, or maybe some of you British people, you hear the word duck and you're just walking off the pitch in shame because duck can mean a score in cricket, right? Any cricketers in the room? How many of you have been bowled out for a duck? All right. Me too. Me too. Zero scores as a duck in cricket. It's bad news if you're number 10 or number 11 batsman and the whole team is relying on you. Painful childhood memories come to the fore. Ducks are also animals and a duck can be an action, right? How do you decide? It's the same word. How do you decide? Context tells you. If we're talking about cricket, duck. If we're talking about an action, someone shouts it, duck. If it's an animal, duck. Quack. So, something in the context has to decide. If you just see the word duck on a page, you have no idea. So, you look carefully at the context and then you've got an idea. What I'm saying is the context here indicates that faithful is the right choice, not believing. I've restructured this point a little bit from my sermon to clean things up, so this is a different point five. It was this point, not the other. So, the context here is children and their fathers. Note this. The potential elder candidate is the father, right? And since we're talking about the description of a child in the context of his relationship between the child and his father, the natural choice of meaning for Pistos would be faithful and not believing and that's because, listen, the biblical requirement of children is that they be obedient to their parents. That's why I preached the first point in my sermon on Sunday. I wanted to show you that the main biblical requirement of children is children obey your parents in the Lord. Honor your father and mother. It's basic, but it's simple. It's like that's what's required. The context here is also to do with household management and not specifically evangelism. Now get this. The parallel in the context here is about the elder as God's household manager and you go back to the previous sermon, what did that mean? Oikonomos means household manager or steward. So, this is verse seven in Titus 1. Titus 1.7.4. Let me read it to you again. For the overseer must be beyond reproach as God's steward. Oikonomos. Household manager. That links it also with, in my view, the idea in 1 Timothy 3.4 that if you can't manage your own household, how can you manage the household of God? That's the picture in 1 Timothy as well. But I want to point out that the parallel in the context here is about the elder as God's household manager and his capability to manage a household. If the test of household management is what is in view, then the comparison in context is between a potential elder's household and the church. Are you following with me? If indeed that's the context. I believe it is. It's obvious. So, the comparison is not between the household and the world. So, it makes sense that it's not the pastor's skills in evangelism that are in view particularly, but his skills, his ability to manage his own household. Now, I don't mean that means it's okay to let your children die and go to hell. I don't mean that. You know I don't mean that. If you could have a window into our home, you would know how much we pray and how much time we spend. If you follow family Bible time, you know much how much time I spend trying to bring the gospel to my child. I ain't giving that up until the day I know she's saved. But I'm saying exegete the text, what's in view. I believe what's in view is the ability to manage the household, not particularly evangelism. Now, more than that, the vocabulary in Titus 1.6 that says not accused of dissipation or rebellious, that fits with a larger context, a larger biblical context that supports the translation of faithful and not believing. Let me just explain. Deuteronomy 21, 18-21. If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother, and though they discipline him, he will not listen to them, then his father and mother shall take hold of him and bring him out to the elders of the city at the gate of this place where he lives, and they shall say to the elders of the city, this our son is. Now, listen to the vocabulary. Stubborn and rebellious. He will not obey our voice. He is a glutton and a drunkard. If you were listening on Sunday, you heard, what's the meaning of obey? To hear submissively, to listen submissively. You listen to the voice of your parents. He will not obey our voice. He is stubborn and that's the opposite of listening submissively. That's listening resistively if you're listening at all. And rebellious, that's the opposite of being obedient. And will not obey our voice. And then, listen to this language. He's a glutton and a drunkard. That's like, this is like Titus 1.6 is drawn from this picture almost, and then they stone him to death. Okay, that's pretty drastic, isn't it? But the contrast in Deuteronomy, now get this, in Deuteronomy 21 verse 18, fast forward, the contrast is not between wild disobedient children and believers. The contrast is simply wild disobedient children and obedient ones. And that case is proven. The child did not have to be circumcised in heart, a believer, in order to avoid being labelled stubborn and rebellious. He will not obey our voice. He's a glutton and a drunkard. What did the child need to do to avoid being stoned at the gates by the community? He just had to submit and obey his parents, right? And that was the basic standard. You just got to, you got to, if he's, if he's rebellious and unsubmissive and wild and gluttonous and disobedient like that, all right, stone him. But don't stone the child because he's, he's not circumcised in heart. If he's obedient, if he's submissive, you don't get stoned at the gates for that. Okay, so that, and the point I'm making here is that the vocabulary in Titus 1.6, not accused of dissipation, debauchery, that's drunkenness, wild living or rebellious, that vocabulary links us to this concept. It's, and it links us to a broader biblical concept, context rather, that points to being faithful as the correct translation, not pointing us to being believing as the correct translation. That's all I'm saying. Bill Barwick, 0.7, Professor of Old Testament, the Master's Seminary, wrote a helpful comment on Titus 1.6, the link's in the bottom. He writes, one could argue that faithful is a better translation because it is more logically opposite of what is involved in dissipation than believing would be. Okay, 0.6, the context, I'm still on context, the context shown in the grammatical construction favours faithful. James Wyatt points out that the whole phrase here in Titus 1.6 parallels the phrase in 1 Timothy 3.5 so exactly that it makes faithful parallel with submissive. You can see that in the Greek, I've given it to you in the English on the next page, children having faithful, that's if you translate it word for word literally, in Timothy, children having in subjection. So if you're going to parallel those two statements grammatically you'd say, wow, that's just so almost exactly the same, but the phrase he uses here is in submission, the phrase he uses there is faithful or believing, which is it going to be? Okay, that tends to make me think it means faithful and it's not believing. We need to speed up, don't we? Now, just to point out that that same logic is used by MacArthur, for example, and others, and it's a good logic, to show how being filled with the spirit in Ephesians 5.18, you know, don't be drunk with wine but be filled with the spirit, and then it goes on, doesn't it? Speaking to one another and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, and then you go to Colossians 3.16 and it's let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, speaking to one another in psalms, hymns and spiritual songs, and they say that look, it's parallel to this, therefore this means that, and that's the same logic that's being applied here by James White to say grammatically actually, pysstos is faithful not believing. Okay, so number seven, the vocabulary in the context of 1.6, Titus 1.6, does not in fact indicate that only older children are in view. Now, you can hear that I'm contradicting the argument of my friend, but I'm just going to say, look, the two words used to explain or further describe or qualify what is meant by pysstos, the first one, assotia, yes, definitely older children in view. Younger children, unless you were in my household, you're not going to be drunk and disorderly. My grandfather used to feed us vodka and lemon, aged five and upwards, and then go down to the dinner table and start an argument with my dad and have us behaving badly, having pre-fuelled us with vodka and lemon in his bedroom. Childhood, that maybe explains a lot about my life, but explains a lot about the mess in our home in those days before Christ came into our home, praise the Lord he did. But most children are not being exposed to that level of drunkenness and dissipation and debauchery, and so I do agree with him in that word, older children are in view, but the next word, annupotaktos, simply means not subject to, not controlled or independent, and I've studied it, I can't make it do anything other than fit perfectly with the meaning of what is used in 1 Timothy 3.4. The word in 1 Timothy 3.4 is upotager, and that's not only used of young children, you can't say that's only young children. In 1 Timothy 2.11 it's used of adult women in the church, in Titus 2.9 it's used of bond servants, they're adults submitting to their masters, it's a word which just means in subjection, in submission, in a status of submission, and so in 1 Timothy 3.4 he's saying to Timothy, an elder must have his children, tekna, no reference to age at all, in submission, they can't be the opposite of that throughout their childhood in the home, and in Titus 1.6 he's saying, I believe, the same thing, they've got to be under control, they've got to be in submission, they can't be out of order, the opposite, the kind of implication of this word is just out of order. So I'm summarising here, but verse point D on the next page, in fact both older children and younger children in the Old Testament and New Testament world were expected to be in submission. I'd point you back to Deuteronomy 21.18 and fast forwards for that, also think about Eli and his older sons, and there's big questions about what to do with elders, children who are adult and leave the home, and what about when they've left the home, and there's other questions I'm not going to answer in this part, but those are hypothetical questions which would take more extensive answer. Okay, so I've given you now seven exegetical technical reasons, now theological reasons, and these will go a lot quicker, I realise it's already 9.15, but you guys stay up all night anyway, don't you, you don't mind. We'll get to the age of accountability later for sure, definitely, thank you. And feel free to shout at me because you know, it'll keep me awake and I like it. No, I'm saying it's for all ages. Up to 80, I'm hoping I'll be long dead and gone by the time I... Yeah, I do. Well, let's talk about adult children in that stage later, but I would argue that from what I can see in the Bible, if children, at a bare minimum, if children are living in the home, they can't be wild and I think you could argue from, let me just answer that very quickly, you could argue from the case of Eli, the prophet, Eli, remember the fat guy that broke his neck and his sons were sleeping with the women who came to offer sacrifice at the gate of the temple. And it was just, and God rebukes him because he did not control his children and he said to them, what you're doing is not good my sons, but they were still under his control, he was their boss, as Mike put it to me earlier in the office, he was their boss. Now I think you could argue from extension that you're the boss in your home. If your children are under your responsibility and they're wild and disobedient and you're not reining them in, God's holding you responsible, that's it. So I could make an argument for that. That's what everyone asks and that's what I can't answer just like that, but I can, we can talk about that. That'd be a good question, maybe the other elders will have wisdom on that. I just don't want to spend too much time dealing with that, which is the kind of extreme hypothetical rather than this, which is the obvious and the job for us is very clear in front of us. We need to get clear on what are the criteria for potential elder candidates and what are the criteria for existing elders. So for now we don't have to answer that question. Let me just put it like that, that was a good cop out, wasn't it? Theological reasons, these will go quicker. Number eight, the fact that it's impossible to tell if someone is truly believing argues against a translation of believing and I'm only just going to have to say one word, Judas. How do you know whether an elder's child is a Judas? You say we can't tell if they're a Judas because Jesus knew, but the other apostles had no idea that Judas was Judas until Judas turned out to be Judas. Why? Because people can lie, they can be hypocrites, they can pretend. Jesus, how do you know if one of your children who says they're a Christian is actually not? What I'm saying is you can't tell, we don't have a Holy Spirit-ometer that we can apply, like two pins on one of those moisture meters that you stick in the wall and you get a needle swing and it's like, yeah, moisture in your wall, you've got a damp problem. If you only could have one of those, we would use it, we would stick pins in you, seriously. We would pin you down before you became a member of this church. I'd get Adam to sit on you and then I would thrust those pins deep into your body if only we could get that answer, oh yes, the Holy Spirit is in this person. For all the shame and humiliation and pain and tears and accusations, it would be worth it because one Judas in this church has the capability of bringing us down, doesn't it? So it's just terrible, we don't have that. We have to exist within the realm of, well, they've got a profession and there's nothing about them that says it's not true. So we can't say you're a hypocrite, so we have to accept your word for it. Now, Jesus warned this to his disciples. Look at point two, point A of point two, Matthew 1034, do not think that I have come to bring peace on earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to set a man against his father and a daughter against her mother and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. A person's enemies will be those of his own household. Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me. Whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. And this was to his disciples. This wasn't to unbelievers. This was to his disciples. He promised them that if they were faithful, it would divide even their own household. And if the translation ought to be believing, and if it's impossible to know actually genuinely whether people fit into that category or not, how is it ever possible to know that someone is qualified to be an elder? You can't, you can't, if the translation is believing genuinely and all the children must be believers and you can't ever really tell if they're truly believers or not. How is it possible to tell? Well, the only way you can tell then is by looking at their outward behaviour to go along with their inward profession. And by saying, well, they're not wild and disobedient, and we're back into the same area that I'm saying that we're in. Okay, number nine. Salvation of all hearers is never guaranteed by the faithful use of means. Now these are theological points. The argument for believers depends on the concept that the power of an elder's testimony accompanied by his consistent life will lead to the salvation of his children. Now, I agree means are absolutely necessary. I am not arguing, don't use means, just rely upon the sovereignty of God. You would be wickedly neglectful, I would be wickedly neglectful, and God uses means. I would, however, say that whilst these means are absolutely essential, I cannot agree, I can't argue for neglecting something God obviously commands, but I would also argue that what is required of fathers at this point is faithfulness in the use of these means, faithfulness in testimony, faithfulness in consistent life, but the results are up to God. We cannot make the results the test of faithfulness. We can't make that the case in the home and then say to pastors when you come into the church, actually, no, no, the results are up to God. We do say that in the church, we say just be faithful, be faithful in the pulpit, just preach the word, live consistently, be faithful, let us shine our lights. God will use it, but we don't know what results he's going to bring, that's up to him. We believe in his sovereignty and salvation, but we can't say that applies in the church, but it doesn't apply in the home. So I'm saying the salvation of all hearers is never guaranteed by the faithful use of means in scripture. 9. No. 10. No other promise exists in scripture to guarantee the salvation of all the children of the elders. I don't have to say much about that because it's the absence of evidence that is the evidence of absence in this case. So it's just like where else do you find that talk? I can't find anything, I can't think of anything and no one else has ever been able to point to anything to say the salvation of the children of elders is guaranteed. It doesn't exist as a promise and it's a striking claim that would make you want somewhere else to find it to actually give it credibility. 11. There's a difference between believing what your father taught you and experiencing the truth of it. Now some like MacArthur and Stott argue that it's impossible to consider someone as faithful who does not believe what is most precious to his or her father. That is a strong argument. That's a really strong argument. That's the kind of argument that makes me tremble, keeps me awake at night, makes me kind of go, I don't want to be wrong there, right? But actually the argument sidesteps the reality that children growing up in Christian homes may accept the truth of what their parents teach without experiencing the truth for themselves yet. So there may not be an open rebellion against it. That would be one thing but they haven't experienced it yet. That's a different thing. To say that they're not saved yet, they haven't experienced it yet, doesn't mean that they're in open rebellion against it yet. So if this argument were reversed, I'm over the page on page 17 and you'll notice with much relief that this is page 17 of 17. So if this argument were reversed I could say that it's not legitimate to call someone unfaithful who is submissive and obedient to their parents but simply remains unsaved or is struggling with questions. Does that make sense to you? Good, because it ceased to make sense to me because I'm getting tired and word blind. So I'm just going to keep reading. Read it again and maybe it'll make sense to me but I'll carry on. All right, some logical arguments to close with, very simple ones. The believing position puts an inappropriate pressure on prospective elders and existing elders to believe their children's profession of faith. You say, Tom, that's a pragmatic argument. Yeah, let me just play it out for a moment. I think this is a very powerful pragmatic argument. I agree it's just a pragmatic argument. We don't let an argument like this rule but this is significant. I want you to put yourself in the position of an elder. I want you to put yourself in the position of an elder whose child professes faith. They say, I believe. They say, I repent. They say, I believe everything and I am asking for forgiveness and I do repent but in your head you're looking at them thinking, I'm not really sure that this faith has been tested and they've counted the cost and they've really, I don't know whether they're just believing to please me because they love me and they believe everything I tell them. I don't yet know whether they're believing because they really believe it and it's going to endure the test of them suffering and that's the belief that they need, right? Now, if to keep your job you've got to say, oh, my children are all believers, there's a great pressure to say, I believe you. When I believe as a faithful parent you should be saying, you know what, let's wait to see whether, I love the fact that you believe, I'm not saying you don't but you know what Jesus said, take up your cross and follow me and I don't think I've seen your faith tested yet. I'm just going to wait and see. We want to see that you're willing to suffer for Christ. You've got to be willing to deny yourself, take up your cross. You've got to be willing to gather with Christ. Are you evangelising? I want to push it back and I want to say that the main thing is that you get the real thing. I know you want to be baptised but we'll see, we'll see. Rather than jumping on it to say, whew, I'm in, all my children are saved. Or put the ball on the other foot. Can you imagine the horrible pressure that a child of an elder would feel to say, I believe, if they knew that their dad's job depended on it? Put yourself in the position of a child that loves their parents. What are they going to say? These are the kind of conversations that we might have and we want to avoid that pressure. I'm going to say to you, look, if ever my child disqualifies me by that child's behaviour, whose fault is that? According to this book, that reflects not so much on them as on me, right? So according to this book, at that point I should say, I resign. I have failed. I need to pay attention to my family, right? That's what should be the case. Not, oh, my child disqualified me. No, I have failed somewhere along the line. Let me step back. Let me re-evaluate. That's what should happen. Not blame the child, look at the parent. If the child is wild and disobedient and unfaithful and so on. So that's what I'm saying but I don't want that pressure on my child. I don't want any of you to put that pressure on my child so that they feel they must say the right things and live in the right way all the time they're around just so that their dad doesn't lose his job. Do you be surprised? Well, maybe you didn't but you'd be surprised and I think you can read from other pastors who've seen that pressure on their children. So I'm just saying that kind of pressure is a practical reality which is not a good practical reality. Now, is that a reason not to believe a strong case for the opposite? No, you never make a practical solution the answer but I'm just putting it out there as another reason. All right, number 13. Nobody actually knows the age of accountability and if you say you know you just add it to scripture you can take a walk. MacArthur tentatively talks about around the age of puberty. Tentatively but he acknowledges nobody knows and okay if you're going to say it's around the age of puberty, what then? Okay, so the children are supposed to be believing what their fathers teach them as children and then that blossom, that simple childish faith blossoming into saving faith as they grow older, well, what's the age? If you're going to say there is a transition between, if you're going to say 1 Timothy 3, 4 refers to young children, Titus 1, 6 refers to old children, you've got to be able to say when otherwise it's impractical, you can't ever say. I suppose if you've got to, well your children are now 40, definitely at the age of, I don't know but who says when? I mean some people would say 8. If a child is capable of being saved they're capable of going to hell. Some people would say oh no it's 12 because that's what the Jews said and other people would say well no they're not adult then, they're just still children. My 12 year old's definitely a child and other people say well 18 obviously, you're 18 when you become an adult aren't you? Well in this country, at this point in time, it's just become illegal to get married even with your parents permission at age 16 so it's definitely 18, there's 21 elsewhere, you can't drink until you're 21 in America, at which age? And so I'm just pointing out the illogicality of it and the reality that if you're going to say that, and these are just logical arguments, if you're going to say that you have to be able to follow it through. Now number 14, if someone's testimony of his credible life ensures the salvation of his hearers then all Jesus' hearers would be saved, especially those closest to him. This is the argument, the power of your testimony and your credible life as an elder is what God uses to save your children, guaranteed. That's the argument. And if, if, and this is the argument expressly put by John Stott in the quote I gave you at the beginning, if he can't, if an elder can't lead those who are most under his influence to Christ, how can he be a leader in the church? Well that's a powerful argument. But if that is true, why weren't Jesus' brothers saved? They grew up with him. You say, well they're not his children. Yeah, but that's point 15. Point 15 is there must be consistency between the standard for elders with children and those without. Everyone, like MacArthur, everyone who argues that the children of elders must be believers in order for the elder to be qualified, they also say, like John Stott who was single and didn't have children, they also say, yes, but if you're single or if you're just childless, you look for those same, those same qualifications you look for in other areas of their life and influence. But there ain't nobody on the planet who applies that consistently to childless elder candidates. Because if you can apply it consistently and say that all the children of believers must be saved by the power of their testimony and their consistent life, then you're going to say, well all the immediate family, surely. Or maybe all the co-workers, surely. Or maybe all the neighbours, surely, of that elder candidate who doesn't have children but he has all that time to evangelise those nearest to him, surely they're going to be converted by his powerful testimony and his consistent life. And here's the clincher for me, that didn't apply to Jesus. His own brothers didn't believe in him. Not only his own brothers didn't believe in him, there were choice men, 12 of them, who walked and talked with him, lived with him for three years. And at the end of it all Judas betrayed him. Judas didn't believe in him. So actually, and if you took the disciples' lives during those three years and you'd say, are they believers? You're like, I'm not sure right now. There are times where you're just like, whew, these guys are coming up with stuff, you know, they're coming up with pride and stuff like that. Which if you saw in your own children, like a lot of Christian parents, do you see that in your children? You're like, are they really saved? I don't know. And then you remember Peter and you go, okay, I guess it's possible, we'll see. But this is the standard that has to be applied consistently if it's going to be applied. That's all I'm saying. All right, 15 reasons why I believe the argument is in favour of the translation of faithful in the sense of loyal, trustworthy, obedient, submissive, instead of believing. I have no idea whether that's convinced you or not. I'm sure it won't have converted you. However, this is the time for your questions. It's time for some of you, obviously, to stretch your legs. Feel free, be at home. If you are at home, you get the luxury of pausing me and coming back later. But don't pause the live stream because you might miss the most important questions which are coming now. I'm good for as long as this takes. I realise you've been here for a long time. What time do you normally go home? Like midnight? Two o'clock. Okay. So we'll be here till the last man standing.
